## Description

Creating a website that houses various types of products that are “in-demand” and allowing a central place to purchase these items such as groceries, electronics, and housing decor. This will all be accessed with the help of an account that needs to be made and then putting stuff into a cart which will save the items (usage of cookies), as well as multiple pages that will redirect us to products aka department names that will then push us to specific tables of products afterwards. Then allows us to checkout at the end of our browsing session.
